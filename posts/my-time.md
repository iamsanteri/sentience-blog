I've come to understand I constantly try to keep my life busy and full activity – and that's how I like it. Maybe it'll always be this way, I don't know. 

So at my current stage of life I once again recognize the joy I get from meeting other people and working towards the countless topics I believe in or find interesting. I seemingly also like changing my location ever so often to keep my mind fresh, helping me stay curious and energetic. It's just my nature, and it helps keep my balance. This way I stay on a sound track, even if it doesn't always play well with others – and that's something I've often suppressed and felt bad about in the past, but I'm now learning to better deal with as I go. It's only normal.

You see, it's my mind and my life. If I don't take care of myself, there's no one else to save me. If I don't control some of the bad aspects of my nature, people – including my own self – will not want to spend so much time with me anymore, and onwards from there such stories tend to be the sad ones.

As I continue to experiencing and perceiving this world in such an intimate and reflective way due to my own apparent sensitivity, I want to gain confidence to worry less, eliminating all the unnecessary thinking – particularly the type that affects my sense of selfhood. 

Finding out how I tick, and acknowledging all these connections, I'm already feeling better and happier, and more engaged in my life along with less darker shadows lingering on my mind. They might always stay there, occasionally trying to sneak out and manifest themselves by taking control of my perceptions when I least recognize it, so it's a lifelong process, and I'll always keep getting better at managing these things. 

Everyone has problems and people go through difficult things at different times – at least it seems to me it's the rule rather than the exception. 

So anyhow, my life isn't too stationary because. for whatever reason, it's how I like it, and it's the life I've chosen for myself. I'll stay on the move with my learning and my progress, so I'll be doing my things at my own pace while staying careful with the responsibilities and roles I assume. 

Coming back to the many days when I'm alone with nothing much going on – I've come to realize a simple thought that makes me happy and energized instead of turning me towards frustration.

Having all these ambitions and wishes about what to keep learning and spending my time on while experiencing new things and building new skills – it's for such things that my stationary and lonely-feeling days fit perfectly well for. It's during days when I have the least things planned, wondering what or where I can spend my time on that I can best progress with my own little goals, or try to relax in a more purposeful and positively lonely way. In all things I like to do there are surely many aspects that are best done in solitude – during such lonely or otherwise boring-feeling days. 

So it's alone where I can best dedicate lots of time on things I care about in a way that isn't possible when I'm busy running around meeting others. 

Some states of relaxation, progress or ideas won't arrive to me from someone else, and it's a false assumption I may have had until now that I'd get that from others. I may have sought for input and guidance from a lot of the things happening outside me that could perhaps help me "show the way". Now I recognize it as immature. The course of action I often took where I focused my attention and demands on someone else and clinging to others is something I want to no longer do.  

It's as if all my purposeless idle time is slightly dangerous and if I don't properly direct my time while ending up scattering it on useless platforms or other apps, I mostly end up going nowhere and be more sad than before.

So I have to appreciate all the moments where I can just sit down and enjoy my own private things and interests, hobbies and work. Alone.

When my favorite days with all-out activity and other people along with good moments finally arrive again – and they always do – I will double enjoy them! Time with my friends, my close ones and all the other great people I have around me is precious. But all the busy-stuff, activities and days with others feel even better again when I know I've spent time also working on my own stuff, things like my Master's thesis, without needing anything from anyone, or anyone needing anything from me. 

As Seneca once wrote, it's not that we don't have enough time, it's rather that we use the time we have wastefully. We fail to treat time as something of value even though it's our most valuable resource. Adding to what Seneca told, my time in solitude is valuable and I shouldn't waste all too much of it either. At least not on all the obsessive unnecessary thinking which is an analytical strength of mine I once thought I had under my control, but which at some time ended up turning against me. 

And just as well, I might enjoy drawing while listening to music, go for a nice bicycle ride or a swim, or enjoy a brief paddling in a river – by myself and in solitude – on my own time.
