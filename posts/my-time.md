I've come to understand that the kind of life I want to be living is rather busy and full of activity. 

Maybe it'll always be that way – I don't know. 

So it's at my current stage of life where I once again recognize I receive joy from meeting other people and working towards the countless topics I believe in or find interesting. Physically, it seems that I also like to change my location ever so often to keep my mind fresh, while as a result, staying curious and energetic. It's probably just my nature and personality, and it helps keep my mind healthy and balanced. This way I stay on an overall sound track, even if it doesn't always play well with others – and it's something I've often suppressed but I now keep learning to better deal with. It's only normal.

You see, it's my mind and my life. If I don't take care of myself, there's no one else to save me. If I don't control some of the bad aspects of my nature, people including myself will not want to spend time with me anymore, and onwards from there those stories tend to always be the sad and depressing ones.

As I continue to experience and perceive this world in such an intimate and reflective way due to my apparent sensitivities, I likewise want to continue gaining confidence to worry less, eliminating all the unnecessary thoughts – particularly ones that affect my sense of self. 

Finding out how I tick, and acknowledging all these connections, I already feel better and happier, and more engaged in life along with less darker shadows lingering on my mind. They'll probably always be there, occasionally trying to break out and manifest themselves, taking control of my perceptions when I'm least recognizing it, so it's a lifelong process, and I'll always keep getting better at managing these things. 

Everyone has problems and people go through difficult things at varying times – at least it's rather the rule, and I'm not the exception. 

So anyhow, my life isn't too stationary because for some reason that's how I like it, and it's the life I've chosen for myself. I'll stay on the move with my learning and progressing with my things at my own pace, I'm staying careful with responsibilities and roles I assume. 

Coming back to the many days when I'm alone with nothing much going on – I've come to realize one simple thought that makes me happy and energized instead of turning me frustrated. 

Having all these ambitions and wishes about what to keep learning and spending my time on while experiencing new things and building new skills – it's for all such things that my stationary and lonely-feeling days fit perfectly well for. It's during days when I have the least things planned, wondering what or where I can spend my time that I can best progress with my own little goals, or try to relax in a more purposeful and positively lonely way. In all these things there are surely many aspects that are best done in solitude – during such lonely and otherwise boring-feeling days. 

So it's all by myself where I can best dedicate lots of time on things I care about in a way that isn't possible when I'm busy running around and meeting others. 

Most relaxation or new progress or ideas won't arrive to me from someone else, and it's mostly a false assumption I may have had until now that I'd get that from others. I may have sought for "the way" and guidance from a lot of the things outside me. It's immature. A course of action where I focus my attention and demands on someone else and cling to others is something I'll no longer do.  

It's as if all the purposeless idle time is slightly dangerous to me and if I don't properly direct it while ending up scattering my attention on useless platforms and other apps, I will mostly end up going nowhere and become sad.

So I have to appreciate all the moments where I can just sit down and enjoy my own private things and interests, hobbies and work. Alone.  

When my favorite days with all-out activity finally arrive again – and they always do – I double enjoy them. Time with my friends, my close ones and all the other great people is precious. The busy-stuff, activities and days feel even better again when I know I've spent quite some time also working on my own stuff, things like my Master's thesis, without needing anything from anyone, or anyone needing anything from me. 

As Seneca once wrote, it's not that we don't have enough time, rather we use the time we have wastefully. We fail to treat time as something of value even though it's our most valuable resource. And adding to what he told, my time in solitude is valuable and I shouldn't waste all too much of it either. At least on all the obsessive unnecessary thinking, an analytical strength I once thought I had all under my control, but which sometime ended up turning a bit against me. 

And just as well, I might enjoy drawing while listening to music, a nice bicycle ride or a swim, or enjoy a brief paddling in a river – by myself and in solitude – in my own time.
