I've come to understand that I constantly try to keep my life busy and full activity – and that's how I like it. Maybe it will always be this way, I don't know. 

So at my current stage of life I once again recognize the joy I get from meeting other people and working towards the countless topics I believe in or find interesting. I seemingly also like changing my location ever so often to keep my mind fresh, helping me stay curious and energetic. It's just my nature, and it helps with keeping my balance. This way I stay on a sound track, even if it doesn't always play well with others – and it's something I've often suppressed and felt bad about in the past, but I now keep learning to better deal with as I go. It's only normal.

You see, it's my mind and my life. If I don't take care of myself, there's no one else to save me. If I don't control some of the bad aspects of my nature, people – including my own self – will not want to spend so much time with me anymore, and onwards from there such stories tend to be the sad ones.

As I continue to experience and perceive this world in such an intimate and reflective way due to my own apparent sensitivities, I likewise want to continue gaining confidence in worrying less, eliminating all the unnecessary thoughts – and particularly the ones that affect my sense of selfhood. 

Finding out how I'm ticking, and acknowledging all these connections, I'm already feeling better and happier, and more engaged in life along with less darker shadows lingering on my mind. They'll probably always stay there, occasionally trying to sneak out and manifest themselves, taking control of my perceptions when I least recognize it, so it's a lifelong process, and I'll always get better at managing these things. 

Everyone has problems and people go through difficult things at different times – at least it seems to be the rule, and I'm not the exception. 

So anyhow, my life isn't too stationary because for whatever reason that's how I like it, and it's the life I've chosen for myself. I'll stay on the move with my learning and my progress, so I'll be doing my things at my own pace while staying careful with responsibilities and roles I assume. 

Coming back to the many days when I'm alone with nothing much going on – I've come to realize a simple thought that makes me happy and energized instead of turning me towards frustration.

Having all these ambitions and wishes about what to keep learning and spending my time on while experiencing new things and building new skills – it's for such things that my stationary and lonely-feeling days fit perfectly well for. It's during the days when I have the least things planned, wondering what or where I can spend my time on that I can best progress with my own little goals, or try to relax in a more purposeful and positively lonely way. In all things I like to do there are surely many aspects that are best done in solitude – during such lonely or otherwise boring-feeling days. 

So it's alone where I can best dedicate lots of time on things I care about in a way that isn't possible when I'm busy running around meeting others. 

Some states of relaxation or new progress or ideas won't arrive to me from someone else, and it's mostly a false assumption I may have had until now that I'd get that from others. I may have sought for input and guidance from a lot of the things outside me that could perhaps help "show the way" . It's immature. A course of action I took where I focus my attention and demands on someone else and cling to others is something I'll no longer be doing.  

It is as if all the purposeless idle time is slightly dangerous for me and if I don't properly direct my time while ending up scattering it on useless platforms or other apps, I will mostly end up going nowhere and become sadder than before.

So I have to appreciate all the moments where I can just sit down and enjoy my own private things and interests, hobbies and work. Alone.

When my favorite days with all-out activity and many other people finally arrive again – and they always do – I will double enjoy them! Time with my friends, my close ones and all the other great people is precious. The busy-stuff, activities and days feel even better again when I know I've spent time also working on my own stuff, things like my Master's thesis, without needing anything from anyone, or anyone needing anything from me. 

As Seneca once wrote, it's not that we don't have enough time, rather we use the time we have wastefully. We fail to treat time as something of value even though it's our most valuable resource. And adding to what Seneca told, my time in solitude is valuable and I shouldn't waste all too much of it either. At least not on all the obsessive unnecessary thinking which is an analytical strength I once thought I had all under my control, but which at some time ended up turning against me. 

And just as well, I might enjoy drawing while listening to music, go for a nice bicycle ride or a swim, or enjoy a brief paddling in a river – by myself and in solitude – on my own time.
