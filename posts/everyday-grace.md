An old wooden armchair rests in the corner of a living room along with a few pillows making it look comfortable and inviting. Fitting in well with the rest of the interior, it strikes its onlooker as elegant and charming. This chair was purchased over a year ago by a young couple from a battered flea market in the center of the town. Coming across it last summer, the man was adamant on not wasting their money as there'd surely be cheaper and more practical chairs available at any other store, but after she insisted, they finally decided to take it home. 

Ever since then, it's been enhancing the ambiance of the couple's living room, and even their pet is found often sitting on it staring outside the window. There are days where the man himself now sometimes stops to appreciate the chair's warmth and a sense of uniqueness it embodies. It's a difficult thing to catch and slow down to enjoy, but it's definitely worth trying amid the rush of their daily lives. 

As part of a fulfilling and a well-lived day where good food has been enjoyed, the body has been exercised, love has been exchanged and no healthy balance has been violated, it's a wonderful thing to take a hot cup of tea and enjoy a moment without any distractions. This sort of a balanced feeling and a moment's appreciation make way for enjoying the chair's material and it's intricate design. 

Sitting in this chair, at this very moment is a beautiful and a unique thing, and the gracefulness of the experience cannot be appreciated enough. For that fleeting moment, everything is well and it's a grand thing to value. Without the unnecessary rush or stress of the allmighty future, nor the regrets of their lived past, it makes the couple stop and appreciate the moment as it is – right now. 

Humans are a sort of supercharged inference machines, obsessed with planning, contemplation, organization and learning from their past actions. The man has understood that a unique piece of appreciation and understanding for the gracefulness of his everyday experience often gets squeezed out and forgotten. He understands that the couple is so fixated on long-running challenges and many common issues that they often forget about the fleetingness of such valuable everyday moments, and that soon already they may, just as well, cease to be. 

It's a beautiful world, and as the man sits down and stops to appreciate the moment with a cup of tea in his hand, it all definitely feels like it's been worth it. 

Things rarely progress in a linear upward fashion, and soon their chair might find itself being re-sold or thrown away. Nobody knows exactly when it will happen or where, but it's likely that it will and as such shouldn't be worried about too much. So as time progresses, it is rather non-linear and janky regarding all things, just like any sort of a sustained behavioral change, adaptation or improvement is rarely all that smooth. They take time, and it's counter-productive to expect things to simply happen. 

There are bumps on the way and a disbalance often ensues to haunt us again. Regressions and failure are an ordinary part of life, and this couple's chair embodies the fleetingness and uncertainty of all the things. The eventual change – the constant flow of time. 

But when the couple has yet again had a day where their sleep was good, the work of the day was productve and their bodies were somewhat strained with physical labor – when nutritious food was enjoyed and interactions with fellow humans and animals had lifted the spirits, a good day was being lived. It's nice then to gracefully sit on the chair and enjoy the comfort and warmth of the moment. The rays of sunlight entering the room. On those good days, the couple catches a moment where their chair is appreciated – a moment where peace, calmness and grace ensues. 

In this case, the chair has lived up to its potential and herein lies the power of all the well-made physical things. It's taken in as it is. It's wonderful, and the slowing down makes things that much more beautiful.
