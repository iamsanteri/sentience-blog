A book lies carelessly forgotten in a corner of the attic. Gentle wind brushes the roof while a distant sound of an automobile can be heard somewhere far away.

This scuffed book seems to have been written by someone who had a lot to say and bought by someone who was looking for some simple answers. On its brown dusty cover is a dim picture that weirdly depicts a peacefully flowing river.

Yet again life opens up another chapter as the previous one fades away. We don't even notice how those precious moments may never be relived again. To cherish an instant is akin trying to catch a small fish in a river. Without a worry. How long does this last?

We try to find harmony and seek for love, sometimes finding a tiny grain of it or even some more. Doesn't the hollowness stem from the inside? Floating down the river, yet another curve becomes visible way up ahead, exciting!

Are your desires sculpted by the outside world?

What is richness? Is it abundance of available time? A butterfly flies over the boat steered by a hero on a finite path. On this path there are no tracks or traces from the ones who might have gone here before.

Dreaming and imagination are superpowers except when planted into an unhealthy mind causing suffering and misery. But is it always like that? What are we afraid of? We don't know, and this is the human experience.

No matter whom we see and meet, on this boat there is only space for one and one only. Looking at the reflection on the surface, it may seem like there are more, but in the end there is only one. To be socially accepted, cooperative and part of the herd, yet in the end always alone. What an unfortunate realization.  

Sometimes the stream is rapid, sometimes it's calm. For me it is good where I am, and so I'm happy.

Why do we have a consciousness?

Becoming part of something larger than oneself â€“ in the end that's what happens, right?

Birds sing beautifully.

It rained yesterday but today it's green and sunny. An old house stands in the distance. It must be deserted. A car can be seen driving over the narrow wooden bridge right in front of a sign where it says: "Land of regrets".  

There is still some way to go.
