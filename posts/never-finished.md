As our world speeds up, some curious over-achievers among us are seeing an ever-increasing amount of emerging topics to keep diving into and learning more about. Eventually however, an individual can reach a point of overwhelming fatigue, where some of the more sensitive among us can easily succumb into an existential depression. Life's external shocks can serve as the trigger, but they are rarely are the root cause. And this, I suppose, is what's happening everywhere around us on a massive scale, bound to become one of the most significant societal problems of our time. 

Outside of the surface-level babble, it's not what they teach us about in schools – yet.

Due to only a limited amount of time, particularly if we spend it unwisely, a healthy dose of self-care becomes progressively more important as an invisible toll builds up. This happens within some of our blind spots we cannot quite perceive, or get a feeling for. As we go about our days, one year after another, many of us don't recognize what's going on until it's too late – if even then. 

And this is why it's important to stop and listen to yourself, and get to know what your body is telling you at a given point in life. 

What I wanted to do in this short post, was to briefly point ou the fact that a surprisingly large amount of things in life cannot just be "ticked off the list" or "marked as done". Even some of the most well-defined concepts, fields and topics we're learning about keep developing at a breakneck speed, and it's only futile to try and keep up in a manner that's unsustainable to us as individuals. That is, in a way that we couldn't have yet possibly evolved to handle. No matter how hard we try, the rug can still be pulled from underneath us at any time. Our inherent need to identify and attach ourselves to things in this cut-throat economy is leading to further unnecessary pain and suffering.

It is, naturally, a noble thing to strive for a feeling of safety, abundance, competence and professionalism for ourselves and expect it from those around us, but it's also fine to slow down and ensure that it remains within healthy boundaries for each of us personally. In a disorienting society with little right or wrong, where our emotions are being rushed to be harnessed by outside agendas, it's no wonder something feels out of place. 

Self-protection mechanisms are already kicking in, and it's liberating to realize that some things may just never finished, and they shouldn't be. As opposed to fixating on our future and past, on our accomplishments, or defining ourselves by a narrow sliver of who we really are, it's ok to let things go and release the need for control.

In life, some people can manage through it all without giving it a second thought, and never crash. Some people are born and raised in loving, caring and healthy families giving them what feels like a thick-layer of insulation from life's crushing pressures. Some people, on the other hand, keep crashing and stumbling throughout their entire lives without taking an intricate look inside.

For those of us who stop to think and to wonder about these things, it's liberating to simply understand that we are never finished – and that is totally fine.
