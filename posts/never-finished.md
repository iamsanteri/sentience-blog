As our world speeds up, some curious over-achievers among us are seeing an ever-increasing amount of emerging topics to keep diving into and learning more about. Eventually, however, an individual can reach a point of overwhelming fatigue, where some of the more sensitive among us can easily succumb into an existential depression. 

Life's external shocks can serve as the trigger, but they rarely are the root cause. And this, I suppose, is what's happening everywhere around us on a massive scale, bound to become one of the most significant societal problems of our time. 

Outside of the surface-level babble, it's not what they teach us about in schools – yet.

When our time is limited, a healthy dose of self-care becomes progressively more important as the invisible toll keeps building up. This happens inside some of our blind spots we cannot quite perceive, or get a feeling for. As we go about our days, one year after another, we don't recognize what's going on until it's too late – if even then. 

And that's why it's important to stop and listen to yourself, and hear what your body is telling you at a given point in life. 

What I wanted to do in this post, was to briefly point out the fact that a surprisingly large amount of things cannot be just "ticked off the list" or "marked as done". Even some of the most stable fields and topics we're learning about keep developing at a breakneck speed, and it's only futile to try to keep up in a manner that's unsustainable for us as individuals. That is, in a way that we couldn't have yet possibly evolved to manage. No matter how hard we try, the rug can be pulled from underneath us at any time. Our inherent need to identify and attach ourselves to external, or otherwise uncontrollable things in this cut-throat economy is leading to a lot of pain and suffering.

It is, of course, a noble thing to strive for a feeling of safety, abundance, competence and professionalism for ourselves and expect it from those around us, but it's also fine to slow down and ensure that it remains within healthy boundaries for each and one of us personally. In a disorienting society where little that can be considered simply right or wrong, where our emotions are rushingly harnessed by outside agendas, it's no wonder we feel like something's out of place. 

As our self-protection mechanisms kick in, it's a relief to realize that some things may just never be finished, and they shouldn't be. As opposed to fixating on our future or our past, measuring ourselves through our accomplishments, or defining ourselves by just a narrow sliver of who we really are, it's ok release and let go of our need to control.

In life, some people can manage through it all without giving things a second thought, and never crash. Some people are born and raised in loving, caring and healthy families giving them what feels like a thick layer of insulation from life's crushing pressures. Some people, on the other hand, keep crashing and stumbling throughout their entire lives without taking an intricate look inside.

For those of us who stop to think and wonder about all these things, it's liberating to simply understand that we are never finished – and that it is totally fine.
