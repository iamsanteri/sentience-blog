As our world accelerates, curious individuals find themselves constantly exploring a vast array of emerging topics. However, even the most dedicated learners can become overwhelmed, leaving the more sensitive among us prone to fatigue and even depression. Life's big shocks may act as the triggers, but they rarely are the root cause. This phenomenon, occurring on a massive scale in our society, is poised to become one of the most significant challenges of our time. 

Outside touching the topic on a surface-level, they don't quite teach us about it inschools yet either. 

In a world where time is precious, prioritizing self-care becomes increasingly crucial. The cumulative toll of our fast-paced lives often builds up in our blind spots, areas that we struggle to perceive or understand. Year after year, many of us fail to recognize the impact until it's too late — if we ever do at all. It's essential to pause, listen to ourselves, and tune in to what our bodies are trying to tell us at different stages of life. 

Numerous aspects of life simply cannot be "ticked off the list" or "marked as done." Even the most stable fields and subjects we study continue to evolve rapidly, rendering it futile to attempt keeping up in an unsustainable manner. Regardless of our efforts, the rug can be pulled from beneath us at any moment. Our innate desire to cling to external, uncontrollable factors in a cutthroat economy often leads to pain and suffering.

While it's admirable to seek safety, abundance, competence, and professionalism for ourselves and expect the same from others, it's also important to maintain a healthy balance, ensuring that our well-being remains a priority. In an ever-changing society where right and wrong become blurred and our emotions are manipulated by external forces, it's no surprise that we sometimes feel out of place.

As our self-protection mechanisms kick in, it's a relief to realize that many things may just never be finished, and maybe they even shouldn't be. As opposed to fixating on our future or our past, measuring ourselves through our accomplishments, or defining ourselves by just a narrow sliver of who we really are, it's ok to release and let go of our need for control.

In life, some people can manage through it all without giving things a second thought, and never crash. Some people are born and raised in loving, caring and healthy families giving them what feels like a thick layer of insulation from life's crushing pressures. Some people, on the other hand, keep crashing and stumbling throughout their entire lives without taking an intricate look inside.

For those of us who stop to wonder about all these things, it's liberating to simply understand that we are never finished – and that it is totally fine.
