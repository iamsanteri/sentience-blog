As our world accelerates, curious individuals find themselves constantly exploring a vast array of emerging topics. Even the most dedicated learners, however, can become overwhelmed, leaving the most sensitive among us prone to fatigue and depression. Life's big shocks may act as triggers, but they're rarely the root cause. This phenomenon – occurring on a massive scale in our societies – is poised to become one of the most significant challenges of our time.

In a world where time is precious, prioritizing one's self-care is becoming increasingly crucial. The cumulative toll of your fast-paced life keeps building up in your blind spots – areas that you struggle to perceive or understand. Year after year, you fail to recognize the impact until it's too late, if you ever do at all. It's essential to pause, listen to yourself, and tune in to what your body is trying to tell you at different stages of life. 

Many aspects of your life simply cannot be "ticked off the list" or "marked as done." Even the most stable fields and subjects you study continue to evolve rapidly, rendering it futile to attempt and keep up in an unhealthy manner. Regardless of your efforts, the rug can be pulled from beneath you at any moment. Your innate desire to cling to external, uncontrollable factors in a cutthroat economy leads to pain and suffering.

While it's admirable to seek safety, abundance, competence, and professionalism for yourself and expect same from others around you, it's also important to maintain a healthy balance, ensuring that your well-being remains a priority. In an ever-changing society where right and wrong become increasingly blurred and your emotions are constantly manipulated by external forces, it's no surprise that you sometimes feel out of place.

As your self-protection mechanisms kick in, it's a relief to realize that many things may simply never be finished, and perhaps they shouldn't be. As opposed to fixating on your future or your past, measuring yourself through your accomplishments, or defining yourself by just a narrow sliver of who you really are, it's ok to release and let go of your need for control.

In life, some people manage through it all without giving things a second thought, and never crash. Some people are born and raised in loving, caring and healthy families giving them a thick layer of insulation from life's crushing pressures. Other people, meanwhile, keep crashing and stumbling throughout their entire lives without ever quite managing to take an intricate look inside.

For those of you who stop to wonder about all these things, it's liberating to simply realize and accept that you may never be finished – and it is totally fine.
