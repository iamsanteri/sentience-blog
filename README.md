## Getting Started

In this project, Yarn package manager is used. The project is intended to be deployed via static build and export functionality of NextJS for simple static web hosting. 

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Santeri's Note

After burning my fingers initially, I decided to not use any experimental features or TypeScript for my first hand-made NextJS project. The API and platform is evolving rapidly, so using a stable and battle-tested functionality is the way to go.  

## Writing posts

Posts reside in top level `posts` directory. You can work on a new post in a different branch and merge when ready. This should be done in order to not have half-finished posts showing up on the live website.
